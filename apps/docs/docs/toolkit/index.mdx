# Overview

Use **Nova Toolkit** to accelerate development across projects fast. Pick the pieces that match your workflow.

## Install

If the package is not in your repo yet, go to **[Setup and Configure](/docs/quickstart/setup#choose-your-path)** and choose **Install into project**.

:::caution Warning
**Nova** must be installed **in your project** before importing batteries. This is because Node.js resolves imports from your project's `node_modules` folder.
:::

:::info
If you wish, you can install Nova **globally** (into the system) and **locally** (into the project) at the same time. They will not conflict with each other.

## Batteries

All items below are **modular**, **explicit**, and **safe to adopt**. Import only what you need. Outputs and behavior are **predictable**.

### Formatters

Turn structured data into **stable, reviewable text** that fits anywhere in your pipeline.

| Battery                                                   | Synopsis                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Markdown Table](/docs/toolkit/formatters/markdown-table) | Render copy and pastable tables for docs, reports, and summaries. |

### Logging

Produce **consistent process messages** and lightweight **run context** that work in local development and automation.

| Battery                                        | Synopsis                                                           |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [CLI Header](/docs/toolkit/logging/cli-header) | Present a simple and customizable banner for projects with CLI.    |
| [Logger](/docs/toolkit/logging/logger)         | Emit logs that are more customizable and safer than `console.log`. |
