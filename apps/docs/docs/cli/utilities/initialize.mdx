Generate or update `nova.config.json` with an interactive wizard that makes the config easy by remembering existing values, guiding each step, and saving when you're done.

## Summary

The `initialize` command scaffolds and maintains `nova.config.json` by opening a guided flow across project metadata, key contacts, and canonical URLs.

Existing values populate each prompt so you edit an accurate snapshot and only persist changes when you confirm them.

## Why Use This Command?

- Skip guessing the structure. The wizard lists each field, explains what it is for, and guides you to fill known values.
- Avoid typos and mismatched formats with built-in validation for slugs, emails, and URLs.
- Stop juggling manual edits. Nova writes the JSON with only the fields you confirm, no extra cleanup required.
- Stay confident making changes. **Dry run** lets you walk through the questions without touching the file until you're ready.

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding** — Create the first `nova.config.json` for a new or migrated repository.
- **Metadata refresh** — Keep project descriptions, contacts, and canonical URLs in sync after ownership changes.
- **Normalization** — Clean up manually edited entries without hunting for typos in raw JSON.
- **Generator support** — Feed consistent metadata to Nova generators so docs, README files, and release notes stay accurate.

## Requirements

- Run the command from the project root (the top-level `package.json`, including monorepos) so Nova can write `nova.config.json`.
- Node.js LTS runtime with either the `nova` CLI installed or access to `npx`.
- Terminal session that can display interactive prompts.

## Usage

<Tabs groupId="install-state">
  <TabItem value="nova" label="nova (installed)" default>

    ```bash
    nova utility initialize
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx (no install)">

    ```bash
    npx --yes @cbnventures/foundation-nova@latest utility initialize
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Editing an existing config?
Existing values are pre-filled in each prompt. Press **Enter** to keep a value, type a new value to replace it, or enter a single space to clear that field.

## Options

| Flag            | Description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `-d, --dry-run` | Skip saving to disk and warn that no files change. |

## Flow Overview

The command loops until you choose **Save & Exit** or **Cancel**. You can edit any category multiple times during the same run.

### Project

- Captures the project display name, package slug, short and long descriptions, and comma-separated keywords.
- Slug validation only accepts letters, numbers, hyphen, and underscore characters.

### Entities

- Manages people or organizations related to the project (authors, contributors, supporters).
- For each entity you can set a name, email, URL, and roles; emails follow a simple pattern check and URLs must be valid HTTP(S).
- Menu supports **Add**, **Edit**, and **Remove** with confirmation before deletion; duplicates and blank roles are trimmed automatically.

### URLs

- Normalizes all canonical project links: `homepage`, `repository`, `issues`, `license`, `logo`, `docs`, `github`, `npm`, and comma-separated funding sources.
- Repository URLs accept `git:`, `git+https:`, `git+ssh:`, `git+http:`, and standard HTTP(S); all other fields require HTTP(S).
- Funding sources are sanitized individually and stored as an array, skipping invalid entries.

## URL Sanitization and Validation

- All URLs pass through sanitization, which trims whitespace, parses with the WHATWG `URL` class, and only persists allowed protocols.
- Enter a single space in any URL prompt to clear the value; malformed entries trigger clear error messages so you can fix them immediately.
- Funding URLs share the same validation, and any values Nova cannot normalize are ignored.

## Saving and Canceling

- Choosing **Save & Exit** writes to a file called `nova.config.json`.
- Choosing **Cancel** exits immediately without persisting changes and prints a debug log.

      },

## Troubleshooting

- **"Must be run inside the project root directory."** — Verify you execute the command where the project root `package.json` resides. App or package folders inside monorepos are not supported.
- **Validation loops keep reappearing.** — Fix the highlighted email or URL before continuing. To drop the value, enter a single space and press **Enter**.
- **No file was created.** — Make sure `nova.config.json` is writable and that you did not pass `--dry-run` or choose **Cancel**.
