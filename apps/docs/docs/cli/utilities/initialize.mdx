Generate or update the Nova config file with an interactive wizard by guiding you towards each step, and saving when you're done.

## Summary

The `initialize` command scaffolds and maintains the `nova.config.json` file by opening a guided flow across project metadata, key entities, and canonical URLs.

Existing values populate each prompt so you can edit an accurate snapshot and only persist changes when you confirm them.

## Why Use This Command?

- The wizard writes the JSON with only the fields you confirm, no extra cleanup required.
- The wizard lists each field, explains what each field is for, and guides you to fill known values.
- Avoid typos and mismatched formats with built-in validation for slugs, emails, and URLs.
- **Dry run** lets you walk through the questions without touching the config file until you're ready.

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding** — Create the first `nova.config.json` for a new or migrated repository.
- **Metadata refresh** — Keep project descriptions, entities, and canonical URLs in sync after ownership changes.
- **Normalization** — Clean up manually edited entries without hunting for typos in raw JSON.
- **Generator support** — Feed consistent metadata to Nova generators so docs, README files, and release notes stay accurate.

## Requirements

- **Node.js runtime** — Use any Node.js LTS release with either the installed `nova` CLI or `npx`.
- **Project root** — Run the command from the directory containing the top-level `package.json` (monorepos included).
- **Interactive terminal** — Make sure the session can display the wizard's prompts.

## Usage

You can run this command in two ways:

<Tabs groupId="install-state">
  <TabItem value="nova" label="nova (installed)" default>

    ```bash
    # Original
    nova utility version

    # Shorthand
    nova util ver
    ```

    **Note:** If Nova is installed **only locally** (inside a project), the command will work **only within that project's directory**. See the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/configuring-npm/folders) for details.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx (no install)">

    ```bash
    # Original
    npx --yes @cbnventures/nova@latest utility version

    # Shorthand
    npx --yes @cbnventures/nova@latest util ver
    ```

    **Note:** If you prefer the shorter `nova` command, see the [Setup and Configure](/docs/quickstart/setup) guide for installation instructions.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

| Flag            | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `-d, --dry-run` | Skip saving to disk (warning will display). |

## Flow Overview

The command loops until you choose **Save & Exit** or **Cancel**. You can edit any category multiple times during the same run.

:::tip Editing an existing config?
Existing values are pre-filled in each prompt. Press **Enter** to keep a value, type a new value to replace it, or enter a single space to clear that field.
:::

### Project

- Captures the project display name, package slug, short and long descriptions, and comma-separated keywords.
- Slug validation only accepts letters, numbers, hyphen, and underscore characters.

### Entities

- Manages people or organizations related to the project (authors, contributors, supporters).
- For each entity you can set a name, email, URL, and roles; emails follow a simple pattern check and URLs must be valid `http://` or `https://`.
- Menu supports **Add**, **Edit**, and **Remove** with confirmation before deletion; duplicates and blank roles are trimmed automatically.

### URLs

- Repository URLs accept `git:`, `git+https:`, `git+ssh:`, `git+http:`, and standard `http://` or `https://`.
- Normalizes all canonical project links: `homepage`, `repository`, `issues`, `license`, `logo`, `docs`, `github`, `npm`, and comma-separated funding sources.
- Funding sources are sanitized individually and stored as an array, skipping invalid entries.

## URL Sanitization and Validation

- Enter a single space in any URL prompt to clear the value.
- All URLs pass through sanitization, which trims whitespace, parses with the WHATWG `URL` class, and only persists allowed protocols.
- Funding URLs share the same validation, and any values Nova cannot normalize are ignored.

## Saving and Canceling

- Choosing **Save & Exit** writes to a file called `nova.config.json`.
- Choosing **Cancel** exits immediately without persisting changes and prints a debug log.

## Output Example

```json title="nova.config.json"
{
    "project": {
      "name": {
        "title": "Example Project",
        "slug": "example-project"
      },
      "description": {
        "short": "Sample settings for a Nova-powered JavaScript toolkit.",
        "long": "Use Nova to keep linting, typing, and release metadata consistent across your JavaScript and TypeScript projects."
      },
      "keywords": [
        "example",
        "nova",
        "tooling",
        "config"
      ]
    },
    "entities": [
      {
        "name": "Example Author",
        "email": "author@example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/author",
        "roles": [
          "author"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Example Collaborator",
        "email": "collab@example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/collaborator",
        "roles": [
          "contributor",
          "supporter"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "urls": {
      "homepage": "https://example.com",
      "repository": "https://github.com/example/example-project",
      "bugs": "https://github.com/example/example-project/issues",
      "license": "https://github.com/example/example-project/blob/main/LICENSE",
      "logo": "https://example.com/assets/logo.svg",
      "documentation": "https://docs.example.com/project",
      "github": "https://github.com/example/example-project",
      "npm": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/example-project",
      "fundSources": [
        "https://github.com/sponsors/example",
        "https://opencollective.com/example"
      ]
    }
  }
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Must be run inside the project root directory."** — Verify you execute the command where the project root `package.json` resides. App or package folders inside monorepos are not allowed.
- **Validation loops keep reappearing.** — Fix the highlighted email or URL before continuing. To drop the value, enter a single space and press **Enter**.
- **No file was created.** — Make sure `nova.config.json` is writable and that you did not pass `--dry-run` or choose **Cancel**.
