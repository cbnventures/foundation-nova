# Terminology

Short, practical definitions for newer developers. Tables list the familiar term first, also known as, then the definition.

## Fundamentals

|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API**    | application programming interface | A defined interface for one program to request data or actions from another.                                                                                                            |
| **SDK**    | software development kit          | A bundle of libraries, tools, and examples for working with an API or platform.                                                                                                         |
| **CLI**    | command line interface            | A program you run in the terminal by typing commands to perform tasks.                                                                                                                  |
| **LTS**    | long term support                 | A release line that keeps receiving security and bug fixes for an extended period of time.                                                                                              |

## Packages and Dependencies

| Term                       | Also known as | Definition                                                                                                         |

| **Peer dependency**        | peer dep      | A package your project must install because a library you use expects to use your copy, with a compatible version. |
| **lockfile**               | package lock  | A file that pins exact versions so installs are repeatable.                                                        |

## JavaScript and TypeScript

| **CommonJS**           | CJS                | Older Node.js modules that use `require` and `module.exports`.                                                                    |
| **compile**            | —                  | Translate source code to a lower-level form such as machine code or bytecode (e.g., C++ → machine code, Python → bytecode).       |
| **transpile**          | source-to-source   | Convert code to a similar-level language or version (e.g., TypeScript → JavaScript).                                              |

| **intersection type**  | `A & B`            | A value must satisfy multiple types at once (e.g., numbers that are even `AND` prime).                                            |
| **nominal typing**     | name based typing  | Requires the same declared type or an explicit relation (e.g., `UserId` is not assignable to `PostId` even if both are `string`). |
| **structural typing**  | duck typing        | Compatible by shape, not by name (e.g., `{ x: number; y: number }` is assignable to `Coordinates`).                               |
