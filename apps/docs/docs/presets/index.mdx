# Overview

Use **Foundation Nova Presets** to lock in strict TypeScript, consistent style, and predictable builds. Pick the layers that match your stack.

## Install

If the package is not in your repo yet, go to **[Setup and Configure](/docs/quickstart/setup#choose-your-path)** and choose **Install into project**.

:::caution Warning
**Nova** must be installed **in your project** before importing presets. This is because Node.js resolves imports from your project's `node_modules` folder.
:::

:::info
If you wish, you can install Nova **globally** (into the system) and **locally** (into the project) at the same time. They will not conflict with each other.

## ESLint presets

Configure ESLint by **composing small layers** into a single **flat config** export. The goal is clear rules, low noise, and fast composition.

### Mental Model
Nova's ESLint presets are **flat config** layers that you **spread** into one export. Think of them as small building blocks. Each layer states intent and adds a focused set of opinions without hiding magic.

Composition follows a simple order:

1. Start with an **ignores** file to keep noise out.
2. Apply strict **code styling** so formatting is consistent project-wide.
3. Add a single **language** layer for the code you write (e.g., TypeScript).
4. Then the **environment** (runtime) or **framework** that matches where it runs.
5. Optionally, pick a **platform**.
6. Finish with any **tool** specifics.

### 60-Second Setup

This example shows a minimal Node.js project using TypeScript, composed with Nova's ESLint presets. Configured through the `eslint.config.ts` or `eslint.config.js` file.

```js
import {
  dxCodeStyle,
  dxIgnore,
  envNode,
  langTypescript,
} from '@cbnventures/foundation-nova/eslint';

export default [
  ...dxIgnore,
  ...dxCodeStyle,
  ...langTypescript,
  ...envNode,
];
```

## TSConfig presets

Configure TypeScript by **chaining a few preset configs** with `"extends"`. Aim for consistent compiler behavior, strict typing, and predictable output with minimal overrides.

### Mental Model
Nova's TSConfig presets are **small layers** you **chain** with `"extends"`.

Composition follows a simple order:

1. Start with **essentials** as the baseline.
2. Apply **strict** for stronger compiler checks.
3. Then add the **environment** (runtime) or **framework** that matches where it runs.
4. Optionally, pick a **platform**.
5. Finish with any **tool** specifics.

The presets set the heavy knobs for you (e.g., `module` with `moduleResolution`, matching `lib` sets, etc.), so your config stays simple.

Keep **local overrides** focused on project wiring: `paths` and `baseUrl` for imports, `outDir` and `rootDir` for layout, `types` for type packages, and use `include` for the files you compile and `exclude` for build artifacts and `node_modules`.

### 60-Second Setup

This example shows a minimal Node.js project using TypeScript, composed with Nova's TSConfig presets. Configured through the `tsconfig.json` file.

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@cbnventures/foundation-nova/tsconfig/dx-essentials.json",
    "@cbnventures/foundation-nova/tsconfig/dx-strict.json",
    "@cbnventures/foundation-nova/tsconfig/env-node.json"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "outDir": "./build",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    },
    "rootDir": "./",
    "types": [
      "@types/node"
    ]
  },
  "include": [
    "./*",
    "./src/**/*"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "./build/**",
    "./node_modules/**"
  ]
}
```
